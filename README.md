# Bike Share Toronto Station Usage

Toronto Bike Share's usage has been on the rise for the past decade, each year higher than the previous, even in 2020! With more riders in the system, Bike Share users can sometimes have a difficult time finding a station to borrow or dock their bikes, if they are not in the "right" location. This web map tracks Bike Station Docks / Bikes availability over the spa of (almost) one week, with data pulled from Toronto Bike Share's website. 

The data is at 5 minute interval from May 21 (Tuesday) to May 26 (Sunday). Come in and find out how Toronto's Bike Share users move around the city!
